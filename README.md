# Molecule IDE

At Molecule we think that you shouldn't have to adapt your workflow to your IDE but
the IDE to your methods, whether you're using cutting edge tooling or advanced
workflows, we provide you a flexible and easy to use tool that will become your
artboard.

Open Source is at the core of our thinking and we want to listen and help our
community to create the best and most modern development platform for your last
innovations.

**Warning:** Molecule is still in an early alpha stage. The current state is far from
what we want to achieve and it is still full of bug. We are working hard to correct
them as soon as possible and to add the features we are planning and you request.
